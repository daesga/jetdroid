# Introduction #
The Samsung JÃ©t (GT-S8000/GT-S8003) is advertised to be smarter-than-smartphone. Unfortunatly the phone software is in some aspects not very smart. The hardware however, is quite capable. Thus nothing is more likely than using an open platform like Android to overcome the obstacles of the original software.

## Please refer to [JetDroid.org](http://www.jetdroid.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12) for status updates ##

We have first versions of the Android system booting and running with limited functionality. You can review the current status in a short video [here](JetDroidVideo.md).

The list of missing features may be longer than the one of supported features. So far we don't have support for USB, wifi, bluetooth, audio, cameras, sensors, GPS, making calls, etc (for details and more recent information look JetKernelReleases). But we are making progess.

The [wiki](Sitemap.md) is a usefull source of all kinds of information about the phone and the project.
