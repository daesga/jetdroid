# Multitool bootloader download #

It is well know that a new/updated bootloader can be downloaded via USB by means of the well known Multiloader tool. This is no big news, but it looks like this method can be used to download any code in place of the bootloder. The Multitool just seems to check the last 1024 bytes to be like below.

If this pattern is appended to some modified code the Multiloader tool loads this and transfers it to the phone in place of the original bootloader. This was tested with a slightly modified original bootloader that adds some code at the end.

Like this a modified bootloader that boots into another OS can be transfered without the need of a JTAG interface.
